<P>Two example input scripts are given, including shocked alpha

equilibrate an initial state with the quantum thermal bath 
at the target temperature and then apply the qbmsst to

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Quantum nuclear effects <A HREF = "fix_qtb.html">(fix qtb)</A> can be crucial 
especially when the temperature of the initial state is below the 
classical limit or there is a great change in the zero point energies 
between the initial and final states. Theoretical post processing 
quantum corrections of shock compressed water and methane have been 
reported as much as 30% of the temperatures <A HREF = "#Goldman">(Goldman)</A>. 
A self-consistent method that couples the shock to a quantum thermal 
bath described by a colored noise Langevin thermostat has been 
developed by Qi et al <A HREF = "#Qi">(Qi)</A> and applied to shocked methane. 
The onset of chemistry is reported to be at a pressure on the shock 
Hugoniot that is 40% lower than observed with classical molecular dynamics.
</P>
<P>This command performs the Quantum-Bath coupled Multi-Scale Shock 
Technique (QBMSST) integration. See <A HREF = "#Qi">(Qi)</A> for a detailed 
description of this method. The QBMSST provides description of 
the thermodynamics and kinetics of shock processes while 
incorporating the quantum nuclear effects. <I>shockvel</I> determines 
the steady shock velocity that will be simulated along direction 
<I>dir</I>.
</P>
<P>It is highly recommended that the system is already in an 
equilibrium state with a quantum thermal bath at temperature of <I>T_init</I>. 
The fix command <A HREF = "fix_qtb.html">fix qtb</A> at constant temperature 
<I>T_init</I> could be performed before applying this command to introduce 
self-consistent quantum nuclear effects into the initial state.
</P>
<P>The parameter of <I>q</I>, <I>mu</I>, <I>e0</I>, <I>p0</I>, <I>v0</I> and <I>tscale</I> are 
described in the command <A HREF = "fix_msst.html">fix msst</A>. The values of <I>e0</I>, 
<I>p0</I>, or <I>v0</I> will be calculated on the first step if not specified. 
The parameter of <I>damp</I>, <I>f_max</I>, and <I>N_f</I> are described in the command 
<A HREF = "fix_qtb.html">fix qtb</A>.
</P>
<P>The fix qbmsst command couples the shock system to a quantum 
thermal bath with a rate that is proportional to the change of the 
total energy of the shock system, <i>etot</i> - <i>etot</i><sub>0</sub>. 
Here <i>etot</i> consists of both the system energy and a thermal term, 
see <A HREF = "#Qi">(Qi)</A>, and <i>etot</i><sub>0</sub> = <I>e0</I> is the initial 
total energy.
</P>
<P>The <I>eta</I> (<i>&eta;</i>) parameter is a unitless coupling constant 
between the shock system and the quantum thermal bath. A small <I>eta</I> 
value cannot adjust the quantum temperature fast enough during the 
temperature ramping period of shock compression while large <I>eta</I> 
leads to big temperature oscillation. A value of <I>eta</I> between 0.3 
and 1 is usually appropriate for simulating most systems under 
shock compression. We observe that different values of <I>eta</I> lead 
to almost the same final thermodynamic state behind the shock, 
as expected.
</P>
<P>The quantum temperature is updated every <I>beta</I> (<i>&beta;</i>) 
steps with an integration time interval <I>beta</I> times longer than 
the simulation time step. In that case, <i>etot</i> is taken as 
its average over the past <I>beta</I> steps. The temperature of the 
quantum thermal bath <i>T</i><sup>qm</sup> changes dynamically 
according to the following equation where &Delta;<i>t</i> is the 
MD time step and <i>&gamma;</i> is the friction constant which 
is equal to the inverse of the <I>damp</I> parameter.
</P>
<center><font size="4"> <i>dT</i><sup>qm</sup>/<i>dt = &gamma;&eta;</i>&sum;<i><sup>&beta;</sup><sub>l = 1</sub></i>[<i>etot</i>(<i>t-l</i>&Delta;<i>t</i>)-<i>etot</i><sub>0</sub>]/<i>3&beta;Nk</i><sub>B</sub> </font></center>

<P>The parameter <I>T_init</I> is the initial temperature of the quantum 
thermal bath and the system before shock loading.
</P>
<P>For all pressure styles, the simulation box stays orthorhombic 
in shape. Parrinello-Rahman boundary conditions (tilted box) are 
supported by LAMMPS, but are not implemented for QBMSST.
</P>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Because the state of the random number generator is not written 
to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart files</A>, this fix cannot be 
restarted "exactly" in an uninterrupted fashion. However, in 
a statistical sense, a restarted simulation should produce 
similar behaviors of the system as if it is not interrupted. 
To achieve such a restart, one should write explicitly the same 
value for <I>q</I>, <I>mu</I>, <I>damp</I>, <I>f_max</I>, <I>N_f</I>, <I>eta</I>, and <I>beta</I> 
and set <I>tscale</I> = 0 if the system is compressed during the first 
run.
</P>
<P>The progress of the QBMSST can be monitored by printing the 
global scalar and global vector quantities computed by the fix. 
The global vector contains five values in this order:
</P>
<P>[<I>dhugoniot</I>, <I>drayleigh</I>, <I>lagrangian_speed</I>, <I>lagrangian_position</I>, <I>quantum_temperature</I>]
</P>
<OL><LI><I>dhugoniot</I> is the departure from the Hugoniot (temperature units). 
<LI><I>drayleigh</I> is the departure from the Rayleigh line (pressure units). 
<LI><I>lagrangian_speed</I> is the laboratory-frame Lagrangian speed (particle velocity) of the computational cell (velocity units).
<LI><I>lagrangian_position</I> is the computational cell position in the reference frame moving at the shock speed. This is the distance of the computational cell behind the shock front.
<LI><I>quantum_temperature</I> is the temperature of the quantum thermal bath <i>T</i><sup>qm</sup>. 
</OL>
<P>To print these quantities to the log file with descriptive column 
headers, the following LAMMPS commands are suggested. Here the 
<A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> energy command is also enabled to 
allow the thermo keyword <I>etotal</I> to print the quantity <i>etot</i>. 
See also the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command.

<P>The global scalar under the entry f_fix_id is the quantity of 
thermo energy as an extra part of <i>etot</i>. This 
global scalar and the vector of 5 quantities can be accessed 
by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>. It 
is worth noting that the temp keyword under the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A>

as described in the command <A HREF = "fix_qtb.html">fix qtb</A>.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix style is part of the QTB package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>All cell dimensions must be periodic. This fix can not be used with a
triclinic cell.  The QBMSST fix has been tested only for the group-ID
all.
