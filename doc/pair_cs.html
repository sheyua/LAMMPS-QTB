<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These pair styles are designed to be used with the adiabatic
core/shell model of <A HREF = "#MitchellFinchham">(Mitchell and Finchham)</A>.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_25">Section_howto 25</A> of the manual for an
overview of the model as implemented in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>These pair styles are identical to the <A HREF = "pair_born.html">pair_style
born/coul/long</A> and <A HREF = "pair_buck.html">pair_style
buck/coul/long</A> styles, except they correctly treat the
special case where the distance between two charged core and shell
atoms in the same core/shell pair approach r = 0.0.  This needs
special treatment when a long-range solver for Coulombic interactions
is also used, i.e. via the <A HREF = "kspace_style.html">kspace_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>More specifically, the short-range Coulomb interaction between a core
and its shell should be turned off using the
<A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command by setting the 1-2 weight
to 0.0, which works because the core and shell atoms are bonded to
each other.  This induces a long-range correction approximation which
fails at small distances (~< 10e-8). Therefore, the Coulomb term which
is used to calculate the correction factor is extended by a minimal
distance (r_min = 1.0-6) when the interaction between a core/shell
pair is treated, as follows
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_cs.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where C is an energy-conversion constant, Qi and Qj are the charges on
the core and shell, epsilon is the dielectric constant and r_min is the
minimal distance. 
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>These pair styles are part of the CORESHELL package.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
