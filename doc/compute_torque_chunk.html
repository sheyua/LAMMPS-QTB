<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the torque on multiple chunks of
atoms.
</P>
<P>In LAMMPS, chunks are collections of atoms defined by a <A HREF = "compute_chunk_atom.html">compute
chunk/atom</A> command, which assigns each atom
to a single chunk (or no chunk).  The ID for this command is specified
as chunkID.  For example, a single chunk could be the atoms in a
molecule or atoms in a spatial bin.  See the <A HREF = "compute_chunk_atom.html">compute
chunk/atom</A> doc page and "<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_23">Section_howto
23</A> for details of how chunks can be
defined and examples of how they can be used to measure properties of
a system.
</P>
<P>This compute calculates the 3 components of the torque vector for eqch
chunk, due to the forces on the individual atoms in the chunk around
the center-of-mass of the chunk.  The calculation includes all effects
due to atoms passing thru periodic boundaries.
</P>
<P>Note that only atoms in the specified group contribute to the
calculation.  The <A HREF = "compute_chunk_atom.html">compute chunk/atom</A> command
defines its own group; atoms will have a chunk ID = 0 if they are not
in that group, signifying they are not assigned to a chunk, and will
thus also not contribute to this calculation.  You can specify the
"all" group for this command if you simply want to include atoms with
non-zero chunk IDs.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The coordinates of an atom contribute to the chunk's
torque in "unwrapped" form, by using the image flags associated with
each atom.  See the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> command for a discussion
of "unwrapped" coordinates.  See the Atoms section of the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> command for a discussion of image flags and
how they are set for each atom.  You can reset the image flags
(e.g. to 0) before invoking this compute by using the <A HREF = "set.html">set
image</A> command.
</P>
<P>The simplest way to output the results of the compute torque/chunk
calculation to a file is to use the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A>
command, for example:
</P>
<PRE>compute cc1 all chunk/atom molecule
compute myChunk all torque/chunk cc1
fix 1 all ave/time 100 1 100 c_myChunk file tmp.out mode vector 
</PRE>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global array where the number of rows = the
number of chunks <I>Nchunk</I> as calculated by the specified <A HREF = "compute_chunk_atom.html">compute
chunk/atom</A> command.  The number of columns =
3 for the 3 xyz components of the torque for each chunk.  These values
can be accessed by any command that uses global array values from a
compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section_howto 15</A>
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>The array values are "intensive".  The array values will be in
force-distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
